# Cloth-Simulation

This project implements **cloth simulation** using particles, springs, and collision detection.  

## Features
- **Particles & Springs**: Simulates cloth behavior using a mass-spring system.
- **Collision Handling**:
  - Cloth-Sphere Collision: Detects and resolves collisions between the cloth and a sphere.
  - Cloth-Floor Collision: Prevents cloth from passing through the floor.
- **Normal Vector-Based Collision Response**:  
  - The collision response is determined using the **normal vector** between the sphere center and the cloth particles.
